# --- Build Settings --- #
# Aura runs via `sudo` but builds packages as the underlying non-root user.
# Here, you can alter who that user is, and where packages are built.

# Uncomment to activate:
# user = YOU
# buildpath = /tmp
# allsourcepath = /var/cache/aura/src
# vcspath = /var/cache/aura/vcs

# --- PKGBUILD Analysis --- #
# Aura automatically scans PKGBUILDs for malicious bash usage and other "bad
# practices". Here, you can turn those scans off.

# Uncomment to activate:
# analyse = True

# --- Misc. --- #

# The editor to use with `--hotedit`.
# Uncomment to activate:
