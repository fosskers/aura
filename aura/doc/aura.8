aura \- package manager utility and AUR helper
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.
.SY aura
.I OPERATION
\*[multi-optional OPTIONS]
\*[multi-optional targets]
.YS
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.
.B aura
is a secure, multilingual package manager for Arch Linux written in Haskell.
.
It connects to both the official Arch repositories and to the
Arch User Repositories (AUR),
allowing easy control of all packages on an Arch system.
.
Aura allows
.I all
pacman operations and provides
.I new
custom ones for dealing with AUR packages.
.
.SH OPERATIONS
.
.TP
.BR \-A ", " \-\-aursync " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving the
.BR A UR.
.
Default action installs packages from the AUR.
.
.IP
During building, makepkg output is
.I not
shown by default.
.
After building, the built
.I *.pkg.tar.xz
file is moved to the package cache and installed from there.
.
This allows for easy AUR package downgrading.
.
.TP
.BR -B ", " \-\-save
.
Manage the saving and restoring of the global package state.
.
Default action stores a record of all currently installed packages and their
versions.
.
.TP
.BR -C ", " \-\-downgrade " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving the package
.BR C ache.
.
Default action downgrades specified
.IR packages .
.
.IP
This process is interactive, allowing the user to choose from any previous
version they have available in the package cache.
.
.TP
.BR \-L ", " \-\-viewlog
.
Perform actions involving the pacman
.BR L ogfile.
.
Default action opens the log for read-only viewing.
.
.TP
.BR \-O ", " \-\-orphans " \*[packages-optional]"
.
Perform actions involving
.BR O rphan
packages.
.
Default action is to list the current orphans.
.
.IP
Orphan packages are packages installed as dependencies,
but are no longer required by any other package.
.
.TP
.BR \-P ", " \-\-analysis
.
Perform security analysis of a
.BR P KGBUILD.
.
Default action reads PKGBUILD from stdin.
.
.IP
Useful for package maintainers and sysadmins to verify the safety of the
PKGBUILD files that they write.
.
To test any package on the AUR, try the following:
.
.RSAMPLE
.BI "aura -Ap " "package" " | aura -P"
.ERSAMPLE
.
.SH AUR SYNC OPTIONS (\fR\-A\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-a ", " \-\-delmakedeps
.
Uninstalls build dependencies that are no longer required after installing the
main package.
.
This prevents the creation of orphan packages.
.
Also note that while the package itself will be uninstalled,
its package file will remain in the cache.
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean
.
After a package's tarball has been built and copied to the package cache,
delete its build directory immediately.
.
.TP
.BR \-d ", " \-\-deps " \*[packages]"
.
View all dependencies of
.IR packages .
.
This process is recursive for AUR packages,
so all dependencies of dependencies (and so on) will also be shown.
.
This can aid the pre-install package research process.
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-info " \*[packages]"
.
View information about AUR
.IR packages .
.
.TP
.BR \-k ", " \-\-diff
.
Show PKGBUILD diffs.
.
When upgrading, using this option will compare the most and second-most recent
PKGBUILDs and output changes in colour.
.
.TP
.BR \-p ", " \-\-pkgbuild " \*[packages]"
.
View PKGBUILDs of AUR
.IR packages .
.
Use this before installing new packages to confirm that the build scripts
aren't doing anything fishy.
.
.TP
.BR \-q ", " \-\-quiet
.
Display less information about certain
.B \-A
operations
(this is useful when processing Aura's output in a script).
.
In particular, search and view dependencies will only show uncoloured package
names.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search " \*[multi word]"
.
Search AUR for packages containing
.IR word s
(not regex) in their names or descriptions.
.
Multiple terms will narrow down the search.
.
Results are sorted by votes.
.
Suboptions:
.
.RS
.
.  TP
.  B \-\-abc
.
Sorts results alphabetically.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-head [ =\fIN\fR ]
.
Only show the first
.I N
results.
.I N
defaults to 10.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-\-tail [ =\fIN\fR ]
.
Only show the last
.I N
results.
.I N
defaults to 10.
.
.  TP
.  BR \-r ", " \-\-both
.
Show results from the official repos as well.
.
.RE
.
.TP
.BR \-u ", " \-\-sysupgrade
.
Upgrade all installed AUR packages.
.B -Au
is like
.B -Su
but for AUR packages.
.
.TP
.BR \-w ", " \-\-downloadonly " \*[packages]"
.
Retrieve AUR
.I packages
source tarballs,
but do not build/install/upgrade anything.
.
.TP
.BR \-x ", " \-\-unsuppress
.
Unsuppress
.BR makepkg (8)
output during building.
.
By default this output is suppressed for a more silent install.
.
Note that when this option isn't used,
.B makepkg
output is actually collected and printed if any errors occur.
.
.TP
.B \-\-json \*[packages]
.
Query the AUR RPC for
.I packages
info as raw JSON.
.
Good for debugging.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-build " path"
.
Specify build
.I path
when building AUR packages.
.
Only the
.I full
path of a pre-existing directory can be used.
.
Example:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -A foo --build=/full/path/to/build/location/
.ERSAMPLE
.
.TP
.BI \-\-builduser " user"
.
Specify the
.I user
to build packages as.
.
This can be useful when logged in as root and a build user is available.
.
.TP
.B \-\-devel
.
When ran with
.BR \-Au ,
adds all development packages to the queue of packages to upgrade.
.
Devel packages are those pulled directly from online repositories,
via git / mercurial / etc.
.
.TP
.B \-\-dryrun
.
When ran with
.BR \-A " or " \-Au ,
update checks,
PKGBUILD diffs,
and dependency checks will be performed,
but nothing will be built.
.
Also usable with
.BR \-M .
.
.TP
.B \-\-force
.
Always (re)build the specified packages.
.
Usually Aura will not rebuild packages whose versions are already available in
the local package cache.
.
.TP
.B \-\-hotedit
.
Before building, prompt the user if they wish to view/edit the
.IR PKGBUILD ,
as well as any
.IR .install " or " .patch
files.
.
However, research into packages (and by extension, their PKGBUILDs) should be
done by the user before any building occurs.
.
Please use
.BR \-Ap " and " \-Ad
for this,
as they will be much faster at presenting information than searching the AUR
website manually.
.
Note that, since aura is run through sudo,
your local value of
.RB $ EDITOR
may not be preserved.
.
Run as
\(lqsudo
.B \-E
aura -A --hotedit \*[ellipsis]\(rq
to preserve your environment.
.
To always allow environment variables to be passed,
have a look at the
.IR env_reset " and " env_keep
options in
.BR sudoers (5).
.
.TP
.B \-\-skipdepcheck
.
Perform no dependency solving.
.
Consider this when using
.B \-\-hotedit
to avoid building annoying dependencies that aren't necessary for your special
use-case.
.
.TP
.BI \-\-vcspath " path"
.
Save the cloned sources of VCS packages (i.e.\& those that end in
.IR *-git ,
etc.) in the given
.IR path ,
instead of the default
.IR /var/cache/aura/vcs/ .
.
.SH GLOBAL PACKAGE STATE OPTIONS (\fR\-B\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean \c
.I " states-to-retain
.
Retains a given number of the most recently saved package states and removes the
rest.
.
.TP
.BR \-r ", " \-\-restore
.
Restores a record kept with
.BR \-B .
.
Attempts to downgrade any packages that were upgraded since the chosen save.
.
Will remove any that weren't installed at the time.
.
.TP
.BR \-l ", " \-\-list
.
Show all saved package state filenames.
.
.SH DOWNGRADE OPTIONS (\fR\-C\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-b ", " \-\-backup \c
.I " path
.
Backup the package cache to a given directory.
.
The given directory must already exist.
.
During copying, progress will be shown.
.
If the copy takes too long,
you may want to reduce the number of older versions of each package by using
.BR \-Cc .
.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-clean \c
.I " versions-to-retain
.
Retains a given number of package versions for each package,
and deletes the rest from the package cache.
.
Count is made from the most recent version, so using:
.
.RSAMPLE
aura -Cc 3
.ERSAMPLE
.
.IP
would save the three most recent versions of each package file.
.
Giving the number 0 as an argument is identical to
.BR \-Scc .
.
.TP
.B \-\-notsaved
.
Remove only those package files which are not saved in a package record (a la
.BR \-B ).
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search \c
.I " regex
.
Search the package cache via a
.IR regex .
.
Any package name that matches the regex will be output as-is.
.
.SH LOGFILE OPTIONS (\fR\-L\fP)
.
.TP
.BR \-i ", " \-\-info " \*[packages]"
.
Displays install/upgrade history for given
.IR packages .
.
Under the \(lqRecent Actions\(rq section,
only the last five entries will be displayed.
.
If there are less than five actions ever performed with the package,
what is available will be printed.
.
.TP
.BR \-s ", " \-\-search \c
.I " regex
.
Search the pacman log file via a
.IR regex .

.SH PRO TIPS
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
If you build a package and then choose not to install it,
the built package file will still be moved to the cache.
You can then install it whenever you want with
.BR \-C .
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
Research packages using
.BR \-Ad \ ( \-\-deps ),
.BR \-Ai \ ( \-\-info )
and
.BR \-Ap \ ( \-\-pkgbuild )!
.
.IP \(bu 2n
.
When upgrading, use
.B \-Akua
instead of just
.BR \-Au .
.
This will remove make deps, as well as show PKGBUILD diffs before building.
.
.SH SEE ALSO
.
.BR aura.conf (5),
.BR pacman (8),
.BR pacman.conf (5),
.BR makepkg (8)
.
.SH BUGS
.
It is not recommended to install non-AUR packages with pacman or aura.
.
Aura will assume they are AUR packages during a
.B \-Au
and attempt to upgrade them.
.
If a name collision occurs (that is, if there is a legitimate AUR package with
the same name as the one you installed) previous installations could be
overwritten.
